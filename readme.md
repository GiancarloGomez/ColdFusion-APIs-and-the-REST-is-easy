# Building APIs with Adobe ColdFusion and the REST is easy
This is the demo code used in presentation at the ColdFusion D.C. Summit.

 - __api__<br />
 This is the API app. It is meant to run on ColdFusion 2016 and requires the **art_gallery** Apache Derby DB to run wright out of the box
 - __client__<br />
 This is a basic HTML / JavaScript SPA that connects via the API for all CRUD operations.
